Description: Implementation of the chain ladder model under the reverse time framework
    introduced in Hiabu (2017) <doi:10.1080/03461238.2016.1240709>.
    It also implements extensions that add flexibility to the individual development factors modeling
    by allowing practitioners to set their own hazard rate model.
